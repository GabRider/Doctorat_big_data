## Use case
A delivery company want to serve customers as quickly as possible. To achieve that it must find the most efficient routes for its vehicles. This implies minimizing travel time and distance while accounting for factors such as customer locations, traffic conditions. To solve this problem, it is possible to use the Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) or the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (DVRP), allowing the company to plan and adapt routes dynamically. By integrating real-time data, such as new delivery requests or traffic updates, the company can adjust its operations on the fly, ensuring that vehicles take the best paths to reach customers faster. 

## Vehicle Routing Problem

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is used to create efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles, each starting and ending at a central depot, to serve a set of customers (e.g., warehouses, stores, schools, or cities). Each customer must be visited exactly once by a single vehicle, with the goal of minimizing overall costs.
##  Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem
The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) is a variant of VRP. Its goal is to create optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles when a new customer requests appears during the day.
