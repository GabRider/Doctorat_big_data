The goal of this repository is to list some datasets/use cases that can help me during my PhD.

# PhD domain
I chose to specialize in quantum computing for my PhD, a field that  interests me and is rapidly expanding. 
Recently, the first quantum computing hardware has been developed, enabling the practical validation of  theories built over the years in this domain.

Quantum computing can be approached from different perspectives, such as physics. In my case, I have decided to focus on 
**algorithm optimization** using the principles of quantum computing.

To achieve this goal, I need to explore various use cases and gather data on real-world problems, as quantum computing has remained confined to the theoretical stage for far too long.

After extensive research, I identified five different use cases: two in the field of algorithms, one in security, and one in machine learning/simulation.

# Algorithms

- [Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem](./Algorithms/Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problem/Readme.md)
- [Time scheduling](./Algorithms/time_scheduling/Readme.md)

# Security
- [Homomorphic functions](./homomorphic_function/Football_Salary/Readme.md)

# Simulation
- [weather Forecasting](./simulation/Readme.md)
